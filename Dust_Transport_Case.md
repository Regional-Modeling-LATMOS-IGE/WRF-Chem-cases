### parent_grid_ratio = 1,3,3, 
    Grids are Arakawa C-staggered: mass points are at cell centers, u-velocities are at east-west cell edges, v-velocities are at north-south cell edges
    it is more computationally efficient and accurate to use a nesting ratio of 3 or 5
    We have tried 5 but did not work in our case
